# Exploring The Sycl Programming Model

***WORK IN PROGRESS***


This repository contains all the code needed to replicate any of my findings from my dissertation. The instructions to run each program are found in their respective folders.

I have ported an OpenCL version of a Lattice Boltzmann Code to SYCL. An OpenMP version is also provided for comparison.

I have ported the kernels from TeaLeaf over to SYCL. I only provide the code to the SYCL Kernel. Other Kernels and other documentation for TeaLeaf can be found at https://github.com/UoB-HPC/TeaLeaf.
