# Exploring The Sycl Programming Model

***WORK IN PROGRESS***


This repository contains all the code needed to replicate any of my findings from my dissertation. The instructions to run each program are found in their respective folders.

I have ported an OpenCL version of a Lattice Boltzmann Code to SYCL. The original OpenCL and an OpenMP version are provided for comparison.

I have ported the kernels from TeaLeaf over to SYCL. I only provide the code to the SYCL Kernel. Other Kernels and other documentation for TeaLeaf can be found at https://github.com/UoB-HPC/TeaLeaf.

The 'How to port to SYCL' folder provides a guide (with examples) to port existing codes to the SYCL programming model. These guides are based on my experiences from undertaking my project.
