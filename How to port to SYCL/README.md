# Porting a program to SYCL

This README aims to help future developers put programs to the SYCL Programming lanaguage. It uses the knowledge I have gain from my experience of porting a Lattice Boltzmann Code from OpenCL to SYCL and from porting the TeaLeaf mini-app from Kokkos to SYCL. Although the guide focusses on porting existing codes from OpenCL or Kokkos much of it will be useful for anyone writing a program in SYCL.
